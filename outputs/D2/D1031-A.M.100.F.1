To avoid tsunami, people should neither reside in the areas close to coastlines nor destroy mangrove forests that protect tidal waves, he said from the agency's compound in Bandung, West Java
Vietnam has in the past two years worked to ensure sustainable development for submerged forests, which face over-exploitation for aquaculture rearing
where there were mangroves, there was substantially less damage
Mangroves grow in thickets along tropical coastlines and have tangled roots that grow above ground
The agency reported one case in Thailand where the mangroves also damaged shallow coral reefs
We need to save the coast
