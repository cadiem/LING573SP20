Robert Blake's defense closed Wednesday without his testimony, gambling that jurors won't buy the state's largely circumstantial case that accuses the actor of shooting the wife he despised after he couldn't find someone willing to commit the crime
``For Blake, there are a lot of ways to lose,'' said Levenson
Blake has pleaded not guilty to killing Bakley
They want to hear that side of the story
"It's all about Rosie," he said, referring to the baby he had with slain wife Bonny Lee Bakley
He appeared agitated as Walters questioned him about why he had not divorced Bakley
