Wolong is a famous giant panda habitat where the world-known China Conservation and Research Center of the Giant Panda is located
The three Beijing giant pandas about to leave were born respectively in 1991, 1999 and 2003, and one of the three Sichuan pandas was also born last year
Zhang said the reserve will send frequent patrols and rescue giant pandas in danger of starvation, but did not say where they would go or how they would be moved
Locals, meanwhile, have been told not to harm the animals if they enter villages looking for food
