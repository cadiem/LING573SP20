Tensions in the region escalated Thursday when tribesmen ambushed a convoy of troops and fired rockets at a military base on the outskirts of Dera Bugti, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Baluchistan province's capital, Quetta
An assertion by opposition politician Hafiz Hussain Ahmed that up to 50 tribesmen were killed in the incident was "exaggerated," Sherpao and Cheema said
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government
Bombs exploded on two trains in Baluchistan on Friday killing two people and wounding eight
