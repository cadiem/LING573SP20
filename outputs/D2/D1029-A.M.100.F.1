Baluchistan was rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this year
Raziq Bugti, spokesman for the provincial government of Baluchistan, said the exodus was sparked in the town of Dera Bugti, 245 kilometres southeast of Quetta after the chief told officials and paramilitary forces to leave
"There is a strong possibility that the attack could be a reaction to the situation in Dera Bugti, because of the violence there," Baluchistan police chief Chaudhry Muhammad Yaqub told AFP
The tribesmen have reportedly set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti
