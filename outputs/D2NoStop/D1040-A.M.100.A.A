Blake has pleaded not guilty to killing Bakley
The court was packed as Blake's adult daughter took the stand
"The implication of counsel in opening argument is that Robert Blake is being prosecuted because he is Robert Blake and a regular John Doe wouldn't be prosecuted under the same circumstances," Samuels said
No eyewitnesses, blood or DNA evidence linked Blake to the crime scene
After their marriage in November 2000, Blake solicited two Hollywood stuntmen to kill her
The cornerstone of the circumstantial case was Blake's hatred for Bakley
The murder weapon was found in a nearby trash bin
