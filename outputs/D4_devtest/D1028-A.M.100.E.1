Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
In an order filed late Friday afternoon and distributed by a court document service today, U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. in Sacramento, California, said defense lawyers Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke had failed to prove the necessity of expanding the jury pool beyond the list of registered voters, media reports said.
The names, addresses and employers of jurors and their spouses will be kept secret once the Unabomber murder trial gets under way with jury selection on November 12 in Sacramento, California.
