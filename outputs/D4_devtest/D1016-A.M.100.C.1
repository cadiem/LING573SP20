Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
Soedjono made his statement in an apparent attempt to correct some media reports that he had met foreign lawyers hired by Soeharto.
Soedjono himself was not available for comment.
A team of investigators will soon question Soeharto, Ghalib said without mentioning time and place for the questioning.
The United Development Party faction earlier asked for a separate decree to contain investigation into Soeharto, officials, former officials and their families.
