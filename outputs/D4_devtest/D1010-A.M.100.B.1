The Japan National Institution of Infectious Disease confirmed the infection after conducting detailed checks on samples from the cow, which tested positive Monday in an initial examination.
Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or from infected blood transfusions.
The first signs of mad cow disease emerged in Britain 10 years earlier, in 1986, but the government there denied there was any danger until the evidence became impossible to ignore.
All results came back negative for the disease.
