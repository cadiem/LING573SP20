South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Samsung apologized Monday over the issue.
Roh has asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case.
Gong had headed a special wiretapping team from the National Intelligence Service, the main spy agency.
Rampant spy agency wiretapping was believed to have ended after Kim Dae-jung, who won the 1997 election, ordered the practice terminated.
