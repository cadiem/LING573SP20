He said the pollutant strip will flow out of Harbin Saturday morning.
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
Premier Wen Jiabao has ordered the environmental department and regional governments to take effective measures to guarantee the safety of potable water, beefing up monitoring work and providing accurate information.
An 80-kilometer chemical slick has been slowly moving downstream along the Songhua River and reached Harbin on Thursday morning.
"It is the chemical plant of the CNPC in Jilin province."
