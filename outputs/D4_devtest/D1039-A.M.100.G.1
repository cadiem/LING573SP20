Dutch NOS public television reported that the suspect in Van Gogh's murder had ties with a man identified as Samir A., arrested on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack in the Netherlands.
Van Gogh, 47, a distant relative of the 19th century painter Vincent van Gogh, had received death threats after the broadcast of the short TV film, "Submission."
He said van Gogh would not have wanted a silent vigil.
Some Muslim activists called van Gogh's film blasphemous.
Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende voiced shock and concern at van Gogh's  assassination soon after the killing.
