A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the "bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) set up an inter-department working group today to coordinate efforts towards the prevention and control of the spread of a mysterious "bird flu" that has killed two people.
Meanwhile, local doctors say that there is no evidence that people may be infected with the flu by eating chickens.
They should tell doctors of their contacts with birds.
