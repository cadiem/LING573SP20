Athens radio quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the plane was being accompanied by two Greek fighter jets when it went down.
"There's a lot here that doesn't make sense," said Nance, who added: "Provided the information from the fighter pilot is right, then we have a high, high probability that we had a malfunctioning crew oxygen system, that the crew didn't know it in time."
In December 2004, three passengers were hospitalized after a Helios plane lost cabin pressure and made an emergency landing at the Larnaka airport.
They saw a cockpit in turmoil.
