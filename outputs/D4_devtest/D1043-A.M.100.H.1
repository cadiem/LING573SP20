Hariri had joined a chorus of objection to interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden.
Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.
But Hariri's supporters have accused Syria and the Lebanese government of orchestrating the assassination.
