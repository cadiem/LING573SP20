_ Sudan asked the Security Council to convene an urgent meeting to authorize a fact-finding investigation into the "barbaric, unjust" U.S. airstrikes on a Khartoum factory.
U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.
Addressing the same press conference, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf condemned Thursday's attack on the north Khartoum factory, in which hospital officials say 10 people were injured.
The letter was from Sudan's foreign minister, Erwa said.
