The Wades Point Inn, between St. Michaels and Tilghman Island, is a white-columned historic inn on 120 acres with stunning views of Chesapeake Bay (www.wadespoint.com, 410-745-2500, 10090 Wades Point Road, McDaniel, Md.).
It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen -- has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.
The Chesapeake Executive Council, a group of state and federal officials overseeing the bay cleanup, voted to support a new central financing authority with the power to disperse billions to various Chesapeake-related projects.
