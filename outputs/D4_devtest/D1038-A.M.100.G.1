Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument:
: "Watch your ash up there!"
The tremor -- accompanied by a cessation in the earthquakes -- suggested that the magma had broken through and was rising smoothlyleading scientists to suspect an eruption might be imminent.
Sandy McComb, 56, of Portland, Oregon, 60 miles (100 km) south, helped in search and rescue operations after St. Helens' devastating eruption, and she came to see the volcano come back to life this weekend.
After 18 years on inactivity, St. Helens roared back to life Friday with a giant plume of steam and ash.
