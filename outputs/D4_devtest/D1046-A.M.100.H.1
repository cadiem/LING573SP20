A Chinese quake rescue team arrived in tsunami-ravaged Indonesia early Friday to help emergency aid efforts there.
The killer tsunami that was touched off by an 8.7-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra island on Dec. 26, has climbed to over 145,000 so far, with over 90,000 deaths reported in Indonesia.
The Japanese government is committed to increase its aid for tsunami-hit Aceh and North Sumatra provinces to 146 million US dollars, Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Yutaka Iimura said on Monday.
Officials said the government was providing extensive support to the WFP for sending the relief to the tsunami victims.
