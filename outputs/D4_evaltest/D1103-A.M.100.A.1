One of the four alleged masterminds of the coordinated bombings of four packed Madrid commuter trains on March 11, 2004, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, alias "Mohammed the Egyptian," was expected to be the first called to testify.
Three men are suspected to have organised the bombings of four commuter trains, which killed 191 people and injured 1,824.
The prosecution says the "final detonator" for the train bombings was a message broadcast by Arab television channel Al-Jazeera on October 18, 2003, from Al- Qaeda's fugitive leader Osama bin Laden naming Spain as a potential target.
