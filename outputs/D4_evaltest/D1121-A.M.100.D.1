The document alleges that Vick was consulted before one losing dog was wet down and electrocuted.
One of the men indicted with Michael Vick on federal dogfighting charges pleaded guilty Monday and has agreed to help prosecutors make their case.
Prosecutors claimed in a July 17 indictment that Taylor found the Surry County property that Vick purchased and used as the site of "Bad Newz Kennels," a dogfighting enterprise.
Since being indicted on charges of sponsoring, gambling on and authorizing acts of cruelty against dogs, Vick has had his football career put on hold -- and in jeopardy.
