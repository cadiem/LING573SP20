The pet food was sold by stores operated by the Kroger Company, Safeway Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and PetSmart Inc., among others, Henderson said.
An unknown number of cats and dogs had suffered kidney failure and about 10 died after eating the affected pet food, the company said.
Menu Foods said it launched the North American recall as a precaution after receiving complaints about sick dogs and cats.
Jeff Burnton of Phoenix said he heard about the recall and found his dog's food on the list.
Burnton said a veterinarian found Nikky showed symptoms of being poisoned.
