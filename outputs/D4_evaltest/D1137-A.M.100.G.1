On Sunday, city officials released a detailed description of the collapse at 303 E. 51st St., saying workers were "jumping" the crane -- intricately adding sections to raise the crane higher -- when a steel collar used to secure the crane to the side of the building fell.
Equipment Corp. Neighbors said they had complained to the city about the crane.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least four people, believed to be construction workers, have died and at least 10 people were injured in one of the city's worst construction accidents in recent memory.
Rubble piled several stories high.
