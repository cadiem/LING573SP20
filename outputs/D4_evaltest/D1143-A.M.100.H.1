O.J. Simpson was arrested Sunday and faces multiple felony charges in an alleged armed robbery of collectors involving the former football great's sports memorabilia, authorities said.
Simpson has said the items belonged to him, and police have questioned him once in their investigation.
Simpson had been interrogated late Thursday following reports of a robbery from a guest's room at the Palace Station casino in which he is alleged to have played a part, police Captain James Dillon told reporters Friday.
A sixth man sought in the armed robbery case against O.J. Simpson has surrendered in court.
