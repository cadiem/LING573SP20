Experts said the annual food safety evaluation campaign has helped to promote regional food safety supervision.
China's food and drug regulator, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), kicked off the 2006 food safety evaluation campaign in 31 major cities on Friday.
The plan was issued by the capital's emergency management office and food safety office on Sunday.
Food poisoning claimed 196 lives in China last year, according to the Ministry.
Food safety has become one of the major concerns of Chinese citizens as a number of food contamination accidents have been exposed across the country in recent months.
