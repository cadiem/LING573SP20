The "Army of Palestine" wing of Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack in Dimona along with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), according to local Channel 2 Television.
In a statement on Monday, the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority condemned the Dimona attack.
One Israeli woman was killed and at least 11 people wounded in the bombing, which triggered scenes of panic in the desert town of Dimona.
Dimona is the site of Israel's nuclear reactor and the explosion took place about 10 kilometers from the reactor site.
Yedioth Ahronoth reported on its website.
