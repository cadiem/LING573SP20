Continuing water shortages, which date from long before the drought, have had a drastic effect on fish resources in the Yangtze, which is home to most of China's freshwater fish species, " said Li Zhenye, director of the marine farm administration in Tongling.
China is among the driest countries in the world, and 400 out of 600 Chinese cities suffer from water shortages for domestic and industrial uses.
Sources with the China Three Gorges Project Corporation said the water shortage in the upper reaches had not affected the world's largest water storage facility.
The salvage operation lasted five hours.
