British officials raised the country's terrorism threat alert to its highest level on Saturday after two men slammed an SUV into entrance doors at Glasgow Airport and turned the vehicle into a potentially lethal fireball.
A British security official, speaking in return for customary anonymity, said the heightened level reflected an assessment that the London and Glasgow attacks were "linked in some ways and, therefore, there are clearly individuals who have the capability and intent to carry out further attacks.
Glasgow Airport was evacuated and closed after a burning car crashed into the main terminal building on Saturday afternoon.
