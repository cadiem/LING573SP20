Lawyers for former Liberian president Charles Taylor, on trial at a UN-backed court in The Hague for alleged war crimes, demanded Friday more time to construct his defence.
Prosecutors expect to call more than 100 witnesses, Rapp said.
In the Taylor case, there is enough money to "take us through the opening statement of the trial," Rapp said, adding that he was confident the rest of the money would come through.
Stephen Rapp, the prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), sought to reassure Liberians that Taylor would be judged fairly when he stands in the dock.
