The blasts all struck within the old walls of Jaipur, a city in western India that's known for its pink-hued palaces, and suspicion quickly fell on Islamic militant groups blamed for a string of attacks on India in recent years.
Another senior Rajasthan police officer, A.K. Jain, said 60 people were killed and 150 wounded in the bombings.
Singh, the state spokesman, said that it was too early to say who was responsible, but that the attack, on a summer's evening when the walled city was thronged, appeared to be intended to ignite religious fury between Hindus and Muslims.
