The effects of the drought can be seen at Lake Mead in Nevada, where a drop in the water level left docks hanging from newly formed cliffs, and a marina surrounded by dry land.
"And it will intensify floods."
-- States will be allowed to hold "conserved" water in Mead from year to year, changing existing rules that require them to use or lose their annual allocations.
