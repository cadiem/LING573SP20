Hundreds more dead turtles have been found elsewhere in the area, and on a pair of islands.
"Not only have they encroached into our waters, they were catching internationally protected turtles."
The World Conservation lists the Hawksbill turtle as critically endangered, while the Green turtle is also endangered.
The poachers were caught by Malaysian marine police on March 28 in waters off the coast of eastern Sabah state with a catch of 274 protected Hawksbill and Green turtles, only 32 of which were still alive.
Should those turtles disappear, it doesn't look so good for fish or shrimp, either.
