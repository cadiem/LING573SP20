Greek authorities blamed domestic militant groups that have carried out a spate of bombings against police and government buildings despite a crackdown of terrorism before the Athens Olympics in 2004.
Greek police said a far-left group, Revolutionary Struggle, had claimed responsibility for the attack.
The pre-dawn rocket attack, which was aimed at the embassy seal and caused no injuries, bore similarities to strikes by deadly groups such as November 17 and Revolutionary Popular Struggle, or ELA, many of whose members are serving life sentences in prison near Athens.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis visited the embassy after the blast.
