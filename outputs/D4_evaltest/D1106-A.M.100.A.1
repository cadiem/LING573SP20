By 2004, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of its 1975 level in the western half of the ocean, according to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
The conference, which brings together the world's regional tuna management groups, is seen as a key step in combating the downturn in one of the most valuable and endangered high-seas fisheries.
Japan's fisheries agency says the country gobbles up a quarter of the world supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.
