Officials engaged in evacuation from remote offshore islands said winds with a speed of 100 to 130 kph started lashing their areas ahead of impending attack by the super severe Cyclone "SIDR".
"The cyclone has battered Bangladeshi coastal areas.
Any severe damage to infrastructure or human casualty due to tempest was not yet received.
"The storm is still moving with great intensity."
The statement said the impact of the storm was mitigated by US stockpiles of emergency supplies as well as shelters and wave barriers that US aid projects had set up in Bangladesh in recent years.
