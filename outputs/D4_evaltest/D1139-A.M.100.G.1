Raja Kiwan, a Dubai-based analyst with PFC Energy, said the hijacking raises "some serious questions" about what is needed to secure such ships when they are on the open seas.
The massive supertanker would seem to present a daunting target for the pirates, who usually operate in small speedboats.
Christensen said the pirates hijacked the vessel on Saturday.
According to the US navy, the tanker -- which is as big as three soccer fields -- is the largest ship ever seized by pirates and the hijacking was the farthest out to sea Somali bandits have attacked a vessel.
