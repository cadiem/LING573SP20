There are no signs that a terror attack was behind the collapse of a bridge Wednesday in Minneapolis, Minnesota that sent cars and trucks tumbling into the Mississippi River, the Department of Homesland Security told AFP.
Later Thursday, officials alerted states to immediately inspect all steel-deck truss bridges similar to the one that collapsed in Minneapolis bridge.
"We've seen it, and we are very familiar with it," Jeanne Aamodt, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said of the 2005 assessment of the bridge.
A school bus had crossed the bridge before it collapsed.
