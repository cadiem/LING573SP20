"The flood situation in northern Bangladesh has been aggravated overnight.
The flood-affected residents were passing days in miseries.
More than a third of Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 145 million people, has been inundated by floods, the Food and Disaster Management Ministry said.
In July and August 2004, floods killed more than 700 people and 38 percent of the country was under water, forcing millions to flee their homes.
The government has mobilised all its essential services and the military for the aid of the flood affected people," said Chowdhury after arriving back in the capital Dhaka.
