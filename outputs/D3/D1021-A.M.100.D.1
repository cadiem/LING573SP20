Prosecutors released Thursday photographs and secretly recorded tapes to support their accusation that Debra LaFave, formerly a schoolteacher, had sex with a 14-year-old student
"Are you sure?" a woman's voice said
"Like, I just don't, I mean, I don't want you lying to your mom
" "Oh, you're being weird," a boy's voice replied
In another part of the tape, the boy expressed his concern about pregnancy
I was just thinking about it, how we've had sex about three times and I should've used like a condom or something
The prosecutors said they have seven such tape recordings
