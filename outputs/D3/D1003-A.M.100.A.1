Three giant pandas living in Beijing Zoo will be sent to Wolong of Sichuan Province, southwest China, Wednesday and three others in Sichuan will fly to Beijing Friday, under an exchange program aimed to maintain the biodiversity of the giant panda population
"It is impossible for giant pandas fed in captivity to survive through natural selection, which will result in similar heredities, " said a zookeeper
A blood bank can also simplify the process of breeding pandas because data on the pandas' blood types and DNA information will be readily available to bring more diversity to the gene pool
