HONG KONG (AP) _ Two batches of Heinz baby food have been recalled in Hong Kong following a similar action in the United States over worries they may contain high levels of lead, the Health Department said Monday
A statement said 14,000 jars of 4-ounce (110 gram) Vegetable Chicken Dinner and 2
5-ounce (70 gram) Beginner Strained Carrots were being recalled by the distributor in the territory
Last week, Heinz officials in the United States said the traces of lead pose little health risks
The problem was discovered in a routine Food and Drug Administration review of supermarket shelves
