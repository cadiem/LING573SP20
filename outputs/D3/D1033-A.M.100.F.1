South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive
Samsung apologized Monday over the issue
Hong and Lee obtained a court order preventing the network from broadcasting the tape so it reported the contents based on a transcript of the alleged conversation instead
Rampant spy agency wiretapping was believed to have ended after Kim Dae-jung, who won the 1997 election, ordered the practice terminated
Kim has denied of any knowledge of the wiretapping
