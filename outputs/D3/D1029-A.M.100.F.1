Tribal rebels attacked a paramilitary convoy in restive southwest Pakistan on Thursday, killing three soldiers and injuring seven others, a senior military officer said
He described the rebels' claims that up to 50 tribesmen had been killed in the exchange of fire as "exaggerated" but said there had been some casualties
The clash erupted when a convoy of soldiers came under attack by armed men belonging to the Bugti tribe in the clan's stronghold of Dera Bugti, some 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of the provincial capital Quetta, he said
They agreed to a cease-fire early Friday
