Robert Blake's defense closed Wednesday without his testimony, gambling that jurors won't buy the state's largely circumstantial case that accuses the actor of shooting the wife he despised after he couldn't find someone willing to commit the crime
Schwartzbach has also closely followed a blueprint he laid out for jurors in his opening statement, but avoided a-trash-the-victim strategy by earlier counsel that dominated the early stages of the case with accounts of Bakley's involvement in a mail-order pornography business
``For Blake, there are a lot of ways to lose,'' said Levenson
Blake has pleaded not guilty to killing Bakley
