On April 12 of last year, state Game and Fish officers shot dead a dangerous nuisance known as Bear #G92, after the grizzly repeatedly broke into buildings searching for food on a ranch near here
The death rate here, where the grizzly population is estimated at 600, was 2 1/2 half times greater than the 15-year average
Most worrying to wildlife biologists was the fact that females made up 60 percent of the dead
Moreover, new management plans might allow hunting of the bears outside the park
If their numbers drop below 500, a management review will be triggered
