Australia strongly opposes Japanese plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday
"To put Australian forces at risk in relation to an area where some people would say you have no claims -- even though we assert them -- could lead to very significant issues in relation to whether what we'd be doing constituted piracy," he told Sky News
"We are vigorously opposed to what they are seeking to do
It is not," Howard said
