Robert Blake's defense closed Wednesday without his testimony, gambling that jurors won't buy the state's largely circumstantial case that accuses the actor of shooting the wife he despised after he couldn't find someone willing to commit the crime
``For Blake, there are a lot of ways to lose,'' said Levenson
``At his age, it could be very close to a life sentence
Blake has pleaded not guilty to killing Bakley
Even people on drugs can tell the truth
But there is what Levenson called ``the Peterson effect
'' Jurors want to hear from the defendant, she said
